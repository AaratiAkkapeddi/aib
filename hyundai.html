					After a series of prototypes, tests, and revisions, the team arrived at the design you see here. The structure uses a minimum of material, organized to support strain where it’s needed most.
					To remove as much weight as possible, normally solid sections are often replaced with honeycomb-like lattices of material. 
					The patterns may look haphazard, but each structure is designed to maximize strength, responding to the simulated stresses of motor torque and payload compression.

				</p><br>
				<p>Finding the right design isn’t just a question of shape. Materials and manufacturing methods are just as crucial. In many places, magnesium casting is used to create the final pieces, offering the best strength to weight ratio.</p>
