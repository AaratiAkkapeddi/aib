			<div class="tri-block bottom">Today’s off-road vehicles are a great choice for adventurous drivers taking on rough terrain. But there are still limits to where even the toughest vehicles can go. Places untouched by automobiles because of a steep or uneven landscape. 
				<br><br>
			Hyundai sees this limitation as an opportunity to create a new breed of vehicle capable of navigating extreme terrain.

			<div class="tri-block bottom">How do you make a car that can drive places previously only accessible by foot? The straightforward approach is to make a car that can walk.  
				<br><br>
			As humans we take walking for granted, but it’s a challenging balancing act for engineers to recreate in robotics. 
			<br><br>
			Fortunately, Hyundai’s experience in both automotive manufacturing and advanced robotics makes them uniquely suited to the challenge of creating a walking car.

			<p>Each of these motors adds more weight that the leg must support, along with the total weight of the vehicle.

				For the concept to succeed, weight must be removed from the supports between the motors. These act as the bones of the leg. And just like your bones, they must be both strong and light.

				Trade-offs of strength, weight, cost, manufacturing complexity and sustainability clearly illustrated early in the process.

				Futuristic materials such as metallic foams, carbon fiber and new metal alloys, are explored as methods for creating components that would be unimaginable with traditional methods.

				<p>After a series of prototypes, tests, and revisions, the team arrived at the design you see here. The structure uses a minimum of material, organized to support strain where it’s needed most.
					<br><br>
				To remove as much weight as possible, normally solid sections are often replaced with honeycomb-like lattices of material. 
					<br><br>
				The patterns may look haphazard, but each structure is designed to maximize strength, responding to the simulated stresses of motor torque and payload compression.

				Perfect for delivering supplies to remote locations, Tiger’s smaller footprint and lighter weight make it possible to be delivered by drone.

				Once it’s dropped off, onboard computers allow Tiger to drive itself to its destination, all while keeping its payload level.
